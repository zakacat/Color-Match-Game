# **Zakacat's Color Match Game**

## **Purpose**

This is the source code necessary to make a color match game with android studio for android phones. This was an assignment for a college course DGL-114 Intro to App Development. The purpose of this assignment was to familiarize the student ("Hey, that's me.") with:
- The Android Studio IDE
- XML
- The MVC design model (Model, View, Controller... not necessarily in that order)
- Java code, especially with 2-dimensional arrays and also the understanding of objects, classes, and methods.
- Best practices, such as referring to resources in separate XML files, isolating Model and Controller, and using camelCase and member variable naming convention.
- Layout and layout design using density-independent pixels, scaleable pixels, and various types of constraints.
- Save state and associated methods

## **About The Game**

This game provides the user with 9 colors displayed in a grid. The program chooses 2 of these colors, mixes them, and displays it as the 'TARGET COLOR'. The user must attempt to select the 2 chosen colors by clicking on them. When 2 of the colors are selected (illustrated by a white 'X') then the user can check to see if they were correct with the 'CHECK' button. Whether correct or incorrect, the user can start a new game at any time with 'NEW GAME'. The correct and incorrect guesses are tracked and displayed for the user to see.

## **Contributors**
The initial set of empty files was provided by the instructor of the course. The ColorUtilities.java class was written by someone else, but I am not sure who. The rest of the work was done by yours truly.
